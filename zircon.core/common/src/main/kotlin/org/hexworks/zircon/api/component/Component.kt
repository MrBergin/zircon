/**
 * A [Component] is a specialized [Layer] which represents a GUI element and used either to
 * display information to the user or to enable the user to interact with the program.
 *
 * Components are organized into a tree structure of [Component] elements nested in each other.
 * The component hierarchy **always** has a [Container] at its root. A child [Component]
 * is **always** bounded by its parent. Containers are branches in this tree while components
 * are leaves. So for example a panel which is intended to be able to hold other components
 * like a label or a check box is a [Container] while a label which is only intended to
 * display information is a [Component].
 *
 * The [Component] abstraction implements the **Composite** design pattern with [Component]
 * and [Container].
